<p class="dropcap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> many surprising effects of <i>electricity</i>,
and the great cures performed by
it, one would imagine, should awaken
the attention of all philosophers
and physicians; but as these cures have been effected
by random experiments, every body has
admired, but no body seems to have considered
how, or by what means, they were performed.
Whence</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these surprising  <i>phænomena</i>,
from which many have entertained hopes
of a great addition to the healing art; yet not
one tolerable account has been given, how, or
from what cause, these <i>phænomena</i> proceeded;
except what has been done by Mr. <i>Freke</i>, surgeon
to <i>Bartholomew hospital</i>; whose admirable piece
shews the great penetration of its worthy author,
with whom I shall join in thinking “it may possibly
be the beginning of much good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="4"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></span></p>

<p>One would think, this silence, on so interesting
a subject, <i>in this enlightened age</i>, can proceed
from nothing but a prejudice in favour of wrong
principles of philosophy: That this is certainly
the taste of the present age, M. <i>Freke</i> seems very
well convinced; for, at the end of his pamphlet,
he takes notice of a show-man, who, “having
published some experiments in electricity, and
hearing that Mr. <i>Freke</i>’s piece was publishing,
own’d, he was much affrightened, because of
the hard fate, as he said, of his booksellers;
but, before he had read two pages, he likewise
owned he had recovered his spirits, when he
found Mr. <i>Freke</i> pretended to think for himself,
and did not let Sr. <i>Isaac Newton</i> think for
him.”</p>

<p>Now, if all persons would take the same freedom
of thinking for themselves, as Mr. <i>Freke</i>
has done, I doubt not but we should soon be
as much ashamed of mentioning the <i>attraction</i>
of <i>gravitation</i>, and the <i>attraction</i> of <i>cohesion</i>
&amp;c. as we now are of the <i>occult qualities</i> of the
ancient philosophers; and should perhaps, then
agree with him, when, speaking of electricity,
he says, that “it is a subject which can, with
more nobleness and dignity, employ the mind
of man, than any he can think of, relating to
the sublunary part of the world. For by it
<span class="pagenum" title="5"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span>you may be acquainted with the immediate
officer of God Almighty, which he seems to
send to all things living: Nay, this power, (according
to his conception,) seems to be the
cause, under <span class="smcap ls01em">Him</span>, both of life and death.
And when it may be more fully understood, it
may afford us means, whereby we may be better
enabled to reason more intelligibly, than
now we can, concerning various operations in
nature.” Therefore,</p>

<p>In the following essay, I shall endeavour to
shew,</p>

<p>I. How, and from whence, this electrical fire
and force are produced; in doing of which I
shall make some observations, in order to shew
that we may form a more exact idea of most of
the great operations of that complete machine,
the universe, from electrical experiments, than
can be attained by any other means: I shall also
produce some experiments which demonstrate,
that the terraqueous globe has no <i>attraction</i>; nor
a solid body, falling towards the earth, any <i>gravitation</i>;
after which, I shall bring other experiments
to prove what is the cause of <i>solidity</i>, and
by what means bodies <i>gravitate</i> towards the
earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="6"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span></p>

<p>II. How this electrical fire and force act upon
the animal frame, and in what disorders they are
likely to be of benefit, and in what not.</p>

<p>I. We are certain, that this electrical fire is
produced, either from the glass globe, or the
air that surrounds it. As to the glass globe,
Mr. <i>Freke</i> has fully proved it cannot proceed from
that; “Because nothing, we know of, can send
out of it a quantity of matter, but there must
be less of that matter remaining, after it has
been so discharged; whereas it cannot be
shewn, but that the glass globe, after ever so
many times using, remains as fit for the same
use, as at first.” From hence we assert, that
this fire must proceed from the surrounding air
being acted upon by the glass globe; and our inquiry
must be, how, and by what means, fire
is produced by the glass globe being made to act
upon the air by which inquiry we shall find,
that <i>air</i>, <i>light</i>, and <i>fire</i> are of the <i>same substance</i>,
or <i>essence</i>; only differently modified, and appointed
for performing different actions: that air
(by being divided or broke to pieces) produces
light; and, if that action is still encreased, it
produces fire. Now as the greatest friction or attrition
are necessary to produce fire, so fire, when
it is once produced, having received the greatest
force, of consequence <i>acts</i> with the greatest force;<span class="pagenum" title="7"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>
and light, with a less; so, wherever there is the
greatest quantity of these small particles of air,
(which we call by the name of fire) in proportion
to what we call gross air, there the action
must be the greatest; by which means the said
fire or light will expand itself, ’till, by mixing
with what we call gross air, it becomes of an uniformity
with it. Now therefore, as experiments
are the sure way either of proving or disproving
any <i>hypothesis</i>; so, to illustrate this, I
shall produce some experiments both from Mr.
<i>Freke</i>, and other authors of unblemished credit,
which prove that air is convertible into light and
fire, and also that light and fire are convertible
back again into air; and likewise, as some parts
of the air are present in all places and things,
that therefore, whenever a violent action either of
solids or fluids is brought on, there light, fire,
or heat, are produced.</p>

<p>To prove this, Mr. <i>Freke</i> has brought, two
very simple, common, but good experiments&mdash;First,
if you slide a wax thread, or small rope,
through your fingers, it will burn them; so likewise
fire is produced, by rubbing two hard bodies
together, or two sticks; or, as is very often
the case, a cart or coach wheel will take fire,
for want of grease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="8"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></span></p>

<p>Another no small proof of this, is what Mr.
<i>Freke</i> has mentioned, viz. that in the year 1703,
in the night of the great hurricane and high
wind, in the strongest part of the tempest, great
quantities of fire were seen passing swiftly over
the hills in the neighbourhood of <i>Warham</i> in <i>Dorsetshire</i>.
The cause of which fire seems very easily
accounted for, according to the above theory,
which might otherwise perhaps, elude the searches
of our greatest philosophers: for in this phænomenon
it is plain, that the attrition of the particles
of the air was so great by the motion of the
wind, as to produce fire or light. Mr. <i>Freke</i> has
some other observations, which much strengthen
the above theory, viz. that in tempestuous weather,
at sea, great flakes of fire are frequently
seen passing, not only in the air, but on the water.
The like is also observed, in the night time,
when the surface of the water is disturbed with
the feathering of oars, or by a vessel or boat passing
swiftly through it. This light or fire <i>in
storms</i> is no new observation; for Mr. <i>Boyle</i> says,
it is common in storms for the fire called <i>Helena</i>,
<i>Castor</i>, and <i>Pollux</i>, to hover about the masts of
ships. And, indeed,</p>

<p>To shew that fire or heat are produced in any
place, or thing, where there is a sufficient motion,
seems not to be very difficult; for water is<span class="pagenum" title="9"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span>
the opposite to fire; and yet, by mixing water
and spirit of wine <i>suddenly</i> together, a heat ensues;
and this will happen if they have been separated
ever so often; but this heat vanishes again
after they are mixed, or as soon as the <i>motion</i>
of their parts ceases. The like will happen
by mixing salt of tartar and water. This phænomenon
seems to proceed from the disposition
and texture of the salt; whose pores are made of
such a proper size, that, on receiving the water
by the pressure of the atmosphere into them, the
texture of the salt may be thereby broken, and its
parts put <i>into motion</i>; which <i>motion</i> causes an <i>attrition</i>
of the air, and so produces a sensible
heat.</p>

<p><i>Boerhaave</i> has another observation, which
seems to prove to a demonstration, that fire or
heat is caused by an <i>attrition</i> of the air; which
observation I shall give in his own words. “A
cannon ball, shot in the winter time, will fly
600 feet in a minute through the cold air,
which makes a greater resistance than any
wind, the most rapid of which only moves
<span class="nowrap">22 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> feet; hence it appears how much <i>friction</i>
the ball must have undergone in its passage,
which by the way did not proceed in a right
line, but by its whirling motion continually
describes a cycloid with every point of its body.
<span class="pagenum" title="10"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>When it falls, it is found quite hot; notwithstanding
in its whole passage, it had continually
met with cold air. This heat could not
have arisen from the flaming gunpowder,
whereby it was exploded, since it only remained
in that flame, an incredible small space of
time, in which it is by no means credible so
solid a body should have acquired such a heat;
which is much more naturally accounted for
from the great attrition of the ball, driven with
such a velocity through the air, and repelled by
a wind, which is above 27 times swifter than
the strongest wind hitherto observed.” <i>Boerhaave</i>’s
Chym. by <i>Shaw</i>, Vol. 1. pag. 244.</p>

<p>I shall mention one more experiment from
Mr. <i>Boyle</i>, which proves that <i>air</i> is not only convertible
into <i>light</i>; but that it may afterwards be
forced through glass, and thereby the same <i>vacuum</i>
be made that is by an air pump. “Liquid
phosphorus being put into a vial, when it was
disposed to shine in the dark, the cavity of the
vial above the liquor seemed to be full of whitish
fumes, though at other times transparent.
The vial, when close stopped, was not luminous
in the dark, but the light or flame appeared
as soon as it was exposed to the air, and
the vial was unstopped; and that the occasion
and propagation of this flame depended on the
<span class="pagenum" title="11"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>contact of the air, appeared, since agitation
would not kindle it, but when the bottle was
unstopped, the kindled flame would gradually
be propagated downwards; the flame always
appeared most vivid the nearer the air, and
when it was extinguished, it first disappeared
in the bottom, and then expired at the top.
When the Vial was unstopped for some time,
when it was stopped again, the air that had leisurely
insinuated itself would cherish the flame
for an hour or two. It was observable, that
when the air had been long pent up with this
shining liquor, its resistance would be so weakened,
that when the vial was unstopped, the
external air would presently rush in with violence,
from whence appears the interest of the
air in propagating the shining of this liquor.
The agitation before the vial was unstopped
would not kindle the light; yet when it was
opened, it would be increased by it, and even
when it was in its dull state, if I poured a little
of it upon my hand, and rubbed it with
my finger, it would presently become vivid,
and emit store of luminous rays, as well as
fumes very offensive to the nostrils; and when
I ceased to rub, and the luminous quality was
lost, it would be renewed again by a repeated
attrition; but in a little time its lucid virtue
<span class="pagenum" title="12"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>would decay,” <i>Boulton</i>’s Epitome of <i>Boyle</i>’s
works, vol. 2. pag. 246. From these experiments
it may be observed, that this liquid phosphorus
could not be made to emit light, without
a communication with the air, not even by
the utmost agitation; though when it had a free
communication with the air, a small agitation
greatly increased the quantity and strength of the
light; that, whenever the air was admitted to
join it, a violent intestine motion came on, by
which motion or attrition, light was not only
produced, but also a great deal of the liquid was
carried off by it; which might be perceived either
by the sight, or smell. And when the vial
had been long without a cork, by which means
it was filled to the utmost with air, the light
would continue a considerable time after the vial
was stopped. We likewise find, that, after the
vial has been stopped some time, and the liquor
has acted upon the air as much as it possibly can,
there is not only a less quantity of gross air than
there was when the vial was first stopped, but
that there is the same <i>vacuum</i> as is made by the
air pump; for as soon as ever it is unstopped, the
air presseth in with violence, the fluid above the
phosphorus (within the vial) being of a more
subtle nature than the air without.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="13"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span></p>

<p>This experiment seems sufficiently to prove,
that air and light are of the same essence or substance;
for we are certain that gross air entered
the vial, and, when it was first stopped, the quantity
of gross air was of an uniformity with the
air without the vial; but at its being opened, we
are assured, there was a less quantity than when
it was first stopped; for the air without presseth
in with the same violence it does into the exhausted
receiver of an air-pump; by which we
may be assured, that some parts of the air have
passed the vial in form of <i>light</i>; and, as the
pores of the glass are not big enough to admit
gross air to return, the consequence must be, that
there is a less quantity of gross air in the vial at
the opening, than there was, when it was first
stopped.</p>

<p>Fire and light are easily proved to be dispersed
through the whole air, from the immediate action
of <i>speculums</i>; and that air itself is of the
same substance with fire seems very plain; for
as fire cannot subsist without air, (and in proportion
to the quantity of air forced into the
fire, in such proportion will be the force of the
fire;) so, neither can fire act but on the outside
of bodies next the air; for even the most inflammable
bodies can only catch fire on their outermost
surface contiguous to the air; and fire in<span class="pagenum" title="14"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>
action, if immerged in a body of the most inflammable
matter, so as to leave no lighted part
above such surface in the air, will be so far from
kindling the inflammable body, that itself will
be extinguished. Thus “if a flaming brimstone
match be plunged into the highest rectified spirit
of wine, the spirit of wine will extinguish
it as intirely, as if dipped in cold water; it
will also extinguish a live burning sparkling
coal; but in the former experiment, if the least
bit of the burning match remains above the
spirit of wine, it will then catch fire, and the
flame will presently spread over the whole surface.”
This is an experiment of the great <i>Boerhaave</i>,
in the first vol. of his chymistry, by
<i>Shaw</i>, pag. 316.</p>

<p>All these experiments, I think, prove to a
certainty, that air is convertible into light. I shall
now bring one experiment, from <i>Boerhaave</i>,
Vol. 1. p. 998. which proves, that fire or light
may be changed into air.</p>

<p>“If a spherical glass vial be kept in a glass-house
furnace, till ready to melt, and then be
hermetically sealed in that heat, and suffered
to cool; if now, it be held inverted, under
cold water, and the end of the neck be carefully
broken off, the water will be violently
forced into it, and fill the glass, but so as to
<span class="pagenum" title="15"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>leave a bubble of true elastic air at the bottom.”</p>

<p>The above experiments prove, that, whenever
air is sufficiently divided or broken to pieces,
light is produced; so that the light or heat in
electricity, is no other than, we find, may be
produced several other ways. For the air being
violently rubbed or ground to pieces between
your hand and the glass globe, whirled briskly
about, the air between your hand and the globe
is ground so small as to be in the form of <i>light</i>,
which is expanded or sent off from the glass
globe in the same manner as <i>light</i> from a candle,
or other luminous body; which emission is continually
supplied by the common air pressing in
between the rays of <i>light</i>, emitted from the glass
ball. That this is the method, by which it acts,
seems very clear: for you may not only hear the
hissing noise of the air pressing towards the globe,
but also plainly feel the air with your hand, near
the globe or tube.</p>

<p>The chief reason (and what has been our
great misfortune) that we have not been able to
discover the cause of electricity, seems to be the
leaving that philosophy, which has been <i>revealed</i>
to us, and putting in its stead <i>theories</i> of <i>our own
invention</i>. For, if we had considered (from the
<i>revealed</i> account that is given us of the formation
of <span class="pagenum" title="16"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>light) the <i>method</i> of its <i>first</i> production, we should
not be at such a loss to account for that light in
electricity, as we hitherto seem to have been;
for we are <i>there</i> told, that the <i>heavens</i>, or airs,
were created in a state of <i>darkness</i>, or inactivity;
and that the first thing God did, was to cause a
<i>motion</i>, or <i>wind</i> amongst the airs; which <i>motion</i>
was to <i>continue</i>, and <i>encrease</i>, till it produced
<i>light</i>; and, after this <i>light</i> was produced, God
called it <i>Day</i>, or as it is expressed in the original,
<i>tumultuousness</i>; it being produced from the
impetuous or violent motion of the airs: and the
<i>darkness</i> he called <i>night</i>, or, as it is likewise expressed,
the time when this <i>languishes</i> or <i>decays</i>;
for the <i>congealing</i> or <i>thickning</i> of the air, by which
<i>darkness</i> is produced, is in proportion as the
<i>force</i> of the <i>light</i> abates.</p>

<p>By all which, I think, we may be assured,
that the <i>light</i>, and all the <i>phænomena</i> produced in
electricity, are caused by a violent <i>friction</i> or
<i>grinding</i> of the grains of air between the glass
globe and the hand.</p>

<p>To illustrate and prove, that this is the method
by which the electrical <i>light</i> is produced, I
shall bring some experiments, from Mr. <i>Hauksbee</i>,
which, I imagine, will make it indisputable.
In his first and second experiments, he shews us,
that by dropping mercury on a glass in an exhausted<span class="pagenum" title="17"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span>
receiver, the <i>action</i> of the mercury on
that subtil fluid gives the mercury the appearance
of fire; but observes, that in all these experiments
on mercury, no <i>light</i> is to be obtained
without <i>motion</i>, and that the same motion which
produced this light in <i>vacuo</i>, did not produce it,
when given to mercurial globules in <i>open air</i>.
This experiment shews us, that there was a larger
quantity of <i>light</i> in the exhausted receiver
than when it was filled with common air; nay
farther, that the <i>subtil fluid</i> contained in the exhausted
receiver, was <i>light</i>; but, for want of <i>motion</i>,
was not perceptible by our senses; but by
so small a motion as that of the descending mercury,
it was pushed forward in the same manner,
as <i>light</i> from a candle, or other luminous
bodies. We also find, that the same experiments
performed in an <i>unexhausted</i> receiver, would not
produce the <i>phænomenon</i> of <i>light</i>; which one
might easily suppose to be the case. For in the
<i>exhausted</i> receiver, any the least <i>motion</i>, that is
sufficient to <i>push</i> this subtil fluid (<i>light</i>) from one
place to another must give us the perception of
<i>light</i>; but in the <i>unexhausted</i> receiver the <i>motion</i>
or <i>friction</i> must be great enough, not only to
<i>push</i> the air from place to place, but also to <i>break
it</i> so small, as to be in form of <i>light</i>: which he
shews us by his third, fourth, and fifth experiments<span class="pagenum" title="18"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span>
to be the case; for by these experiments he
produced <i>light</i> in an <i>unexhausted</i> receiver; but
then the <i>motion</i> or <i>agitation</i> was required to
be much <i>greater</i> than that which produced <i>light</i>
in <i>vacuo</i>. The difference of these two <i>lights was
very considerable</i>, and consisted particularly in this,
that the luminous particles are <i>distinct</i> and <i>separate</i>
in the experiment performed in the <i>open air</i>;
and <i>united</i> and <i>blended</i> into one continued body
of <i>light</i>, in the other experiments in <i>vacuo</i>;
which difference proves to a demonstration, that
the exhausted receiver was full of nothing but
<i>light</i>; for, on shaking the mercury therein, the
whole body of the receiver seemed to be <i>one continued
body of light</i>; but on shaking the mercury
with ever so great a violence in the common
air, it seemed full only of <i>little</i>, <i>bright</i>, <i>twinkling
sparks</i>; and not one continued body, as in <i>vacuo</i>.
For, as the appearance of <i>light</i> is produced in
the common air, by the <i>friction</i> of the mercury
against the glass receiver, <i>breaking</i> or <i>grinding</i>
the air to pieces (which small particles put on
the form of <i>light</i>) so, when the common air
<i>presses</i> in between these small particles, the appearance
must be, and cannot be otherwise than
is shewn by these experiments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="19"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span></p>

<p>These many and various experiments abundantly
prove, that <i>light</i> is produced as above described;
and not, as the generality of people have
imagined (from that mistaken notion of <i>action</i>
being performed by <i>solids</i> and not by <i>fluids</i>) that
this electrical <i>light</i> proceeded from the glass
globe, emitting, what they call, <i>electrical effluvia</i>,
which has been shewn before to be impossible;
because if any quantity of matter sends off part
of its own body, there must be less of that body
remaining, than before the above matter was
sent off, which we find is not the case of the
glass globe; and to prove that it does not, I shall
bring one experiment more from Mr. <i>Hauksbee</i>
which will put it beyond doubt.</p>

<p>Pag. 27. he shews us, that by a violent <i>attrition</i>
of <i>woollen</i> against <i>woollen</i> in <i>vacuo</i>, he produced
<i>light</i>, as well as from any <i>hard</i> or <i>electrical</i>
body; but not so vivid, nor in so large a quantity.
Now, as woollen is reckoned by all to
be a <i>non-electrical</i> body, it shews us that the <i>light</i>
must proceed from the <i>attrition</i> of the air, and
not from the <i>electrical body</i>, as has been falsely
imagined.</p>

<p>As <i>light</i> may be produced by other methods
than have been yet described, as from <i>rotten wood</i>,
<i>fish</i>, <i>meat</i> &amp;c. I shall endeavour to give an account,
how, and in what manner, that <i>light</i> is<span class="pagenum" title="20"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>
produced. Mr. <i>Boyle</i> (in vol. 2. p. 233. of the
epitome by <i>Boulton</i>) tells us, that by putting
<i>rotten wood</i>, <i>fish</i>, <i>flesh</i> &amp;c. in the receiver of an
air-pump, and then extracting the gross air, they
all, in a little time, lost their <i>shining</i> or <i>luminous</i>
quality; but, upon a re-admission of air, this
<i>luminous</i> quality returned. From which we may
learn, that the air is essentially necessary to continue
this <i>light</i>; and, of consequence, that this
<i>light</i> is produced by the <i>action</i> and <i>re-action</i> of
the air on the body, which cause an <i>intestine
motion</i> of its parts; and thereby the emission of
the said light; for when any thing begins to ferment
and <i>putrify</i> (which cannot be performed
in any place, but where the gross air is present)
the <i>intestine motion</i> of its parts is thereby <i>increased</i>;
which <i>motion</i> acting upon the air pressed into
it, the air is thereby <i>ground</i> very small, and
by the continual pressure of the atmosphere is
sent out so small, as to be in form of <i>light</i>.&mdash;In
the common <i>fermentation</i> of liquids, when it
rises to any height, those particles of <i>light</i> being
<i>stopped</i>, and <i>entangled</i> by the <i>watry parts</i> of the
fermenting mass, thereby produce <i>heat</i>; and some
mixtures will produce <i>light</i>, <i>heat</i> and <i>flame</i> on
fermentation; as <i>steel</i>, <i>water</i>, and <i>sulphur</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="21"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span></p>

<p>By these experiments we have a clear idea of
the means and method by which <i>fermentation</i> is
performed, which operation has been hitherto
unintelligible. From hence we may likewise see
the reason why, in an air either <i>too hot</i> or <i>too
cold</i>, <i>fermentation</i> cannot be performed; for in
an air <i>too cold</i>, the pressure is <i>too great</i>, and also
the grains of air <i>too large</i> to <i>enter</i> and <i>divide</i> the
thing to be <i>fermented</i>; by which means the <i>motion</i>
of its parts requisite to <i>fermentation</i> is prevented;
but in air that is <i>too hot</i>, there must be
just the contrary effect, for there the parts of the
thing to be <i>fermented</i> are so far <i>expanded</i>, and the
air so <i>rarified</i>, as to pass through the body with
little or no obstruction, and of consequence to
produce little or no <i>intestine motion</i> of its parts;
and that there is in <i>fermentations an intestine motion</i>
of the parts of a <i>fermenting</i> liquid, is easily discernible
by the naked eye. This also gives us the
reason, why the <i>glow-worm</i> shines only in the
summer months, when the air is greatly <i>rarified</i>,
or <i>divided</i>, and then requires but a small <i>motion</i>
to give it the form of <i>light</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>light</i> proceeding from <i>diamonds</i> &amp;c. seems
to be easily accounted for from the <i>motion</i> of
the <i>airs</i>; that there is a <i>perpetual motion</i> of the
<i>airs</i>, may be proved by the following experiment.
In a still place, suppose a close darkened<span class="pagenum" title="22"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>
room, illuminated only by one small hole in the
window shutter; where, if a person at rest views
the enlightened current of air sideways, as it extends
along the room, he will perceive a <i>surprising
motion</i> of the dusty atoms therein, <i>perpetually
rolling and tossing</i> about <i>with great rapidity</i>.
This <i>motion</i> must be very <i>considerable</i>, as it is <i>perpetual</i>,
and pushed on with the power of <i>gravity</i>
in the air equal to a column of water 33
feet high. By this <i>action</i> on <i>diamonds</i>, whose
<i>pores</i> are very <i>small</i>, and the bodies themselves
of such a <i>make</i> and <i>hardness</i>, as that, when
the air is pressed on them with so great a <i>force</i>
as that of the <i>incumbent atmosphere</i>, the air is
<i>broke exceedingly small</i>, and, by the continuance
of the <i>pressure</i>, is sent off from the body in
form of <i>light</i>. We likewise find from experiments,
that where <i>diamonds</i>, or other bodies of
that kind, have not their outward parts of a
proper <i>make</i>, or their <i>substance</i> of a <i>sufficient hardness</i>
or <i>closeness of parts</i>, to emit <i>light</i> with no
greater <i>force</i>, than the pressure of the <i>atmosphere</i>
only, then this deficiency may be supplied by
<i>rubbing</i>; by which means the air is <i>ground</i> to
pieces, and emitted in form of <i>light</i>, as is shewn
in all electrical experiments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="23"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span></p>

<p>One great property of <i>light</i>, or, as it is commonly
called the <i>electrical effluvia</i>, is (as Mr.
<i>Hauksbee</i> has proved from many experiments,)
that it passes <i>through glass</i>, as water does through
a sieve, or as if no body of matter interposed.
This <i>light</i> of itself, when <i>pure</i>, or <i>simple</i>, hurts
or destroys no material bodies; but when <i>pushed</i>
on by the following air with <i>great violence</i>, and
<i>meeting</i> with a <i>great resistance</i> from an impeding
body, the <i>conflict</i> is so great, that if the following
air <i>presses</i> on with <i>sufficient violence</i>, it <i>dissolves</i>
or <i>destroys</i> the <i>solidity</i> of any material body. As
all bodies become <i>solid</i> according to the <i>temperature</i>
of the surrounding air; some retaining their
<i>solidity</i> in such a degree of <i>heat</i>, as <i>metals</i> of most
kinds; whilst others require a particular degree
of <i>cold</i> before they become <i>solid</i>, as <i>water</i> &amp;c.
which when froze is as much a <i>solid</i> as any thing
else&mdash;this proves that the <i>solidity</i> of bodies depends
on the <i>temperature</i> of the air, as will be
more fully proved hereafter.</p>

<p>The glass globe, with the electrical experiments,
seems to give a very clear idea in what
manner the <i>sun</i> is <i>supported</i>, how this <i>terraqueous
globe</i> and the rest of the <i>planets</i> are made to
<i>move</i>, and <i>continued in motion</i>; and also, what is
the cause of the <i>attraction</i> of the <i>sun</i>, <i>earth</i>, <i>moon</i>
and the rest of the <i>planets</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="24"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span></p>

<p>That the <i>sun</i> is the chief, material, ruling agent,
is very clearly revealed; as are some of its
chiefest actions on the planets and the rest of the
universe. For, in the sun we find a power of
melting, dividing and (with the assistance of the
air) expanding and sending out the air, first in
form of <i>fire</i>, and afterwards in that of <i>light</i>;
which power seems to be so regulated, as to be
able to reach the extremities of the universe,
where it is <i>congealed</i>, <i>condensed</i>, and <i>returned</i> back
again to the <i>sun</i>, to be again <i>melted</i>, <i>divided</i>, and
sent out as before. This action seems to be represented
by water in a <i>still</i>, for there the fire,
forcing its way through the water contained in
the <i>still</i>, carries off some of the watry particles
with it; and when it has reached the head of
the <i>still</i>, if it has no passage into the outward air,
and the <i>action</i> of the fire is not great enough to
break the <i>still</i>, it is by the coldness of the surrounding
air (or as is commonly the case by the
coldness of water placed thereon for that purpose)
<i>condensed</i> and <i>returned</i> into the water contained
in the body of the <i>still</i>, there to be <i>rarified</i>,
<i>expanded</i>, and sent off in <i>steam</i>, as before.</p>

<p>We must suppose the streams of <i>light</i> to be
always acting on one side of this terraqueous
globe, and there <i>dividing</i>, <i>expanding</i> and <i>rarifying</i>
the air; the consequence of which must be<span class="pagenum" title="25"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>
a kind of <i>vacuum</i>, which is immediately filled
by the <i>pressing in</i> of the <i>congealed air</i> from the
extremities; and as the earth is placed in this
fluid of airs, we may as easily conceive that the
air pressing in as above, must, with it, turn round
the earth, in the same manner, and with as much
ease, as water does a common mill-wheel, or the
air a wind-mill. By these powers also the terraqueous
globe is kept <i>solid</i> and <i>entire</i>; for, was
this force once taken off, it would soon drop to
<i>atoms</i>, notwithstanding the pretended <i>attracting</i>
power of its materials.</p>

<p>To confirm what is here advanced, I shall
bring an experiment (which Mr. <i>Boyle</i> has laid
down as a paradox) which proves that this terraqueous
globe has no <i>attraction</i>, nor any <i>solid</i>,
falling towards it, any <i>gravitation</i>; but that all
bodies <i>are forced</i> to it by the <i>incumbent atmosphere</i>,
as much as water is <i>forced</i> up a pump by
it (the atmosphere) which, till the time of the
great Mr. <i>Boyle</i>, was imagined to be performed
by, what they called, the <i>suction</i> of the pump.
But this is no more than has often happened in
philosophy, where when we cannot well account
for any thing, we put the <i>effect for the cause</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Boyle</i> found that a <i>solid body</i>, as <i>ponderous</i>
as any yet known, though near the top of the
water it would sink by <i>its own weight</i>, yet if it be<span class="pagenum" title="26"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>
placed at a greater depth than twenty times its
own thickness, it will <i>not sink</i>, if its descent be
not assisted by the <i>weight</i> of the <i>incumbent water</i>.
To prove this, he gives us a curious experiment,
viz. by keeping off the <i>pressure</i> of the water,
from the <i>top</i> of the <i>sinking body</i>, and <i>sinking</i> it to
a proper depth, he found, that the <i>most ponderous</i>
body would be <i>buoyed up</i>, and <i>supported</i> by
the water only. See the 2d vol. of <i>Boulton</i>’s epitome,
pag. 305. This experiment shews us beyond
all contradiction, that the <i>earth</i> has no
power of <i>attraction</i>, nor a <i>descending body</i> any
power of <i>gravitation</i>; for if it had, the farther
it was sunk in the water, the nearer it must be
to the centre of the earth, and of consequence
the <i>attraction</i> must be the greater; but this, we
find, is contrary to experience; so that the whole
power of descending is impressed upon it by the
<i>air</i>, or by other bodies forced upon it by the <i>incumbent
air</i>. This experiment alone is more than
sufficient to destroy the fine theories of <i>attraction</i>
and <i>gravitation</i>; it also shews us how, and by
what means, two marble slabs, finely polished,
are what they call <i>attracted</i> to each other, and
require a great force to separate them; a force in
proportion to the breadth of the slabs; but this
has been shewn by other experiments to be nothing
but the <i>pressure</i> of the <i>air</i>, or <i>atmosphere</i>;<span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>
for put them into an air pump, and extract the
<i>gross air</i>, and they will immediately separate from
each other.</p>

<p>One reason, which seems to have led us into
the mistake that the <i>solidity</i>, or <i>firmness</i> of bodies
is not caused by the <i>air</i>, has been, that, for the
generality, we consider the <i>air</i>, or <i>atmosphere</i> as
<i>pressing</i> only <i>downwards</i>; for if we had considered
that it <i>presseth</i> equally <i>every way</i>, as well as
<i>downwards</i>, (as <i>Boerhaave</i> in his chym. by <i>Shaw</i>,
vol. 1. p. 389. has shew by the following experiment)
I believe we should not have overlooked
that force, or have thought it insufficient for this
operation. “Fill three glass vessels, the one of a
cylindrical figure, the other conical, the third
bellied with a cylindrical neck; let these be
filled to the brim with fair water, and covered
with a single piece of paper, so as to touch the
surface of the water, and by pressing it down
with the hand, prevent the external air insinuating
between the paper and the water; if
the glasses be now inverted, whilst the paper
remains close with the palm of the hand, and
the hand be afterwards gently withdrawn, the
water will still remain in the glasses. The same
holds true, though the glasses be held horizontal,
or in any other position.” As the cause of
the <i>solidity</i> or <i>firmness</i> of bodies is the <i>pressure</i> of<span class="pagenum" title="28"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>
the <i>air</i> or <i>atmosphere</i>, so likewise it must depend
on the <i>make</i> and <i>size</i> of the <i>pores</i> of such bodies;
for bodies whose <i>pores</i> are <i>smallest</i>, must be acted
upon with a greater power than those whose
<i>pores</i> are <i>largest</i>, or whose <i>pores</i> are so <i>large</i> as
not only to admit <i>light</i>, but also <i>common air</i> into
them. This Mr. <i>Hauksbee</i> proves by a curious
experiment, for having placed two brass hemispheres,
of <span class="nowrap">3 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> inches diameter, upon each other,
and then extracting the gross air out of them by
the air pump, and by these means taking off the
<i>resistance</i> of the <i>common air</i> that was <i>within</i> the
two brass hemispheres, he says, it required 140
pound weight to separate them; this experiment
with that of the two marble slabs before mentioned,
is a demonstration of the <i>power</i> that keeps
<i>solid bodies</i> from <i>falling</i> to <i>pieces</i>. And even, if
these slabs are not so <i>perfectly smooth</i>, yet the weting
them with water, which prevents the gross
air from <i>entering</i>, will produce the like effect.
That solids <i>expand</i> themselves by <i>heat</i> or <i>fire</i>, is
proved by heating an iron rod in the fire: in
which case, it is always found to be <i>bigger</i> and
<i>longer</i> when <i>hot</i> than <i>cold</i>; and it was the opinion
of <i>Boerhaave</i>, that cold <i>consolidates</i> all those
that are called firm bodies; that is, brings that
part, which we call <i>body</i> in them, into a <i>less compass</i>
than before, and thus <i>unites</i> the matter thereof<span class="pagenum" title="29"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>
more closely together: by which means the
<i>cohesion</i> of the whole mass is usually increased;
which makes what we call, <i>strength</i> and <i>firmness</i>
in bodies.</p>

<p>Having shewn that <i>solid bodies</i> have no power
either of <i>attraction</i> or <i>gravitation</i>, and that their
<i>firmness</i> or <i>solidity</i> depends on the <i>pressure</i> of the
<i>atmosphere</i>; I shall now endeavour to shew, from
electrical experiments, how, and by what means
they <i>descend</i> towards the earth.</p>

<p>What is called the <i>attraction</i> of the <i>earth</i>
seems to be performed in the same manner as
that of the <i>glass globe</i> in electricity; the explaining
of which will give us a clear idea, by
what means <i>heavy bodies</i> are <i>forced</i> towards the
terraqueous globe. In accounting for this electrical
<i>attraction</i>, Mr. <i>Hauksbee</i> seems to be very
clear; for, says he, “if by the heat and rarefaction,
consequent upon the attrition, the medium
contiguous to the glass be made specifically
lighter; then of course, to keep up the
ballance, the remoter air, which is denser, must
press in towards the tube, and so carry away
(in the torrent) the little bodies lying in its
way, thither also. The various irregularities in
the excitation, or the emission and discharge of
the electrical matter or light from the tube
(which will be followed with proportional irregularities,
<span class="pagenum" title="30"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>in the motion and tendency of the
denser air, towards the glass globe, by the hydrostatical
laws) may be sufficient to account
for the various uncertain motions of the little
bodies carried towards the glass globe.” This
account of Mr. <i>Hauksbee</i>’s being so very clear, it
is a little surprising that he should allow the
power of <i>attraction</i> to matter, as in some places
he does; for this is no more than in other words,
telling us, that the air round the ball is <i>divided</i>
and <i>rubbed</i> or <i>ground</i> to pieces by the <i>friction</i> between
the glass globe and your hand, and thereby
made to <i>expand</i> itself; so the air pressing in
to make up that deficiency, forces every thing
towards the glass globe, that by its number of
particles is not able to withstand the <i>current</i> of
<i>air</i>, pressing towards the globe. So in like manner
near the surface of the earth, the sun-beams
being <i>reflected</i> by the terraqueous globe, must by
these means be in a greater quantity near the surface
of the earth, than at a distance from it; and
so <i>divide</i>, <i>expand</i> and <i>rarify</i> the air near its surface,
which <i>rarified</i> or <i>divided</i> air is forced off
from the earth on all sides, by the <i>pressing</i> in of
the air from above, which must of consequence
<i>drive</i> every thing before it, towards the earth.
By which we find, that the cause of bodies <i>descending</i>
towards the earth, is not from any <i>pro<span class="pagenum" title="31"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>perty</i>
either of the <i>earth</i> or of the <i>descending bodies</i>;
but that these are <i>forced</i> towards that, by
the surrounding <i>air</i>, in its said <i>motion</i>.</p>

<p>To prove that this is the method by which, in
electricity, bodies are forced towards the glass
globe, I shall bring an experiment or two from
Mr. <i>Hauksbee</i>; and as these experiments prove
to a certainty, that this is the manner of the <i>attraction</i>
in <i>electricity</i>, it will give us little room to
doubt, but that the <i>attraction</i> of the <i>earth</i> is performed
in the same manner.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Hauksbee</i> observed, that the <i>electrical effluvia</i>
were not only perceiveable by sight; but also,
if the hand was held near the tube, seemed
to make such sort of strokes upon the skin, as a
number of fine limber hairs pushing against it
might be supposed to do: and in order to find
whether the electrical <i>attraction</i> was regular and
uniform, he made the following curious experiment,
shewing that all bodies, not too heavy,
are <i>forced</i> (or, as is commonly supposed, <i>attracted</i>)
to a cylindrical glass, equally all round, if
these bodies are, as <i>they term it</i>, within the sphere
of its activity.</p>

<p>This experiment seemed to affect Mr. <i>Hauksbee</i>
so much, that (speaking of electricity) he
says, “it affords us a sort of <i>representation</i> of the

<p>“For, says he, having observed (in electricity)
that light bodies, placed near any part of
the rubbed cylinder, seemed to be equally attracted,
I contrived a semicircle of wire, which
I could fasten at a constant distance, making it
encompass the upper semi-cylindrical surface
of the glass, at 4 or 5 inches distance. This
wire had several pieces of woollen threads fastened
to it at pretty near equal distances. The
length of them was such, that being extended
in a direction towards the center of that imaginary
circle, on the surface of the glass, in the
plane of which the wire was placed; they
would then reach within an inch of the circumference
of that circle: but if left to their
own liberty, they hung in that parallel portion
represented, fig.&nbsp;1. The cylinder was
placed with its axis parallel to the horizon;
and in this posture, it was turned swiftly
<span class="pagenum" title="33"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>round; and then by the rapid motion and agitation
of the surrounding air, the threads were
placed into such portions, as are expressed fig.
2. viz. they were all lifted up and bent upwards
from the axis of the cylinder.</p>

<p>“All this while, there was only the swift motion
of the cylinder round its axis, without any
attrition, but now when I came to apply my
hand to the lower part of the glass (so swiftly
whirled about) and consequently to add attrition
to the former motion; the threads presently
began to change their direction, and all
harmoniously pointed to the center of the circle,
in whose plane the wire was placed, as in fig.&nbsp;3.
neither were they at all disordered or flung out
of that position, by the wind occasioned by
that violent motion (but as if there had been
no such hurry of air about them) they still
persisted in their central direction; I found I
could by shifting the place of the attrition hither
or thither, draw the threads towards this
or that end of the cylinder; but yet they all
still went uniformly converging towards some
center in the axis of it; so that they formed
themselves into a sort of conical surface.</p>

<p>“Farther, if the wire with its loose threads
was reverted, so as to encompass the lower part
of the cylinder (as before it did the upper part)
<span class="pagenum" title="34"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>yet the effect still answered with the same exactness.
For the threads were all erected into so
many strait lines, still directing themselves towards
a center in the axis of the glass.</p>

<p>“Hitherto the axis of the cylinder was placed
horizontally; in the next place I set it in a vertical
position, so that it stood perpendicular to
the plane of the horizon; in which case I made
use of a wire hoop, which was necessary to be
placed parallel to the horizon, that it might
encompass the cylinder, in the same manner as
the semicircular wire did before: only one
small part of this wire was left open, to make
way for the touch of the hand, which was to
give the attrition. And the wire being thus
placed, it was evident that the threads (without
some external force to support them) must all
flag and hang perpendicularly downwards. Yet,
as soon as the motion and attrition were given,
the threads presently began to be extended; and
as if they were become stiff and hard, formed
themselves into an horizontal plane; their loose
ends pointing to a center in the axis of the
glass, as before.</p>

<p>“And thus (in all sorts of positions whatsoever,
both of the wire and of the glass too) were
the threads acted upon by a sort of centripetal
force; to the laws of which they were always
<span class="pagenum" title="35"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>conformable.”
See <i>Hauksbee</i>’s experiments, page 53 &amp;c.</p>

<p>It may be observed in this experiment, that
the <i>attractive</i> power of bodies does not lie in <i>solids</i>,
as has been falsly imagined, neither have such
bodies any <i>centripetal</i> or <i>centrifugal</i> force; but
that this <i>power</i> and <i>force</i> are given them from
<i>without</i>. For, on placing the wire with the
threads round the cylinder, they were all <i>forced</i>
(or as it is often called, <i>attracted</i>) towards the
<i>earth</i>; but, on giving a <i>violent motion</i> to the cylinder,
they were drove from the cylinder, as if
forced by a strong wind; but, by applying the
hand to the glass cylinder, they were recalled, and
all pointed to a center in the axis of the cylinder:
and this <i>central</i> direction might be altered at any
time, by only moving the hand to different parts
of the cylinder; the threads always pointing to
the place where the <i>attrition</i> was made: by
which we find, that the <i>central</i> force, both of
the cylinder and the threads, are caused by the
<i>attrition</i> of the <i>air</i> between your hand and the
cylinder; whereas, at any other time, they are
quite inactive: so we are assured that these <i>central</i>
forces which have been imagined to be <i>within</i>
the <i>solid</i>, are not there, but in the <i>air without it</i>.</p>

<p>On putting something between any of the
threads and the cylinder; then, those threads<span class="pagenum" title="36"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>
would return to their first and <i>natural position</i>,
viz. point towards the center of the earth. So,
as Mr. <i>Hauksbee</i> observes, “in these small orbs of
matter we have some little resemblances of the
<i>grand phænomena</i> of the <i>universe</i>.”</p>

<p>Another thing observable was, “that by putting
these threads within a glass, when they became
extended, this position of the threads
would be altered at any time on the approach
of one’s hand, finger, or any other body, to
the surface of the glass.” This is sufficient
proof that the <i>light</i>, or as it is generally called,
the <i>electrical effluvia pass</i> through the <i>glass</i>, with
as much ease as water does through a sieve.</p>

<p>One thing which seemed a little surprising to
Mr. <i>Hauksbee</i> was, that upon exhausting the <i>gross
air</i> out of the tube or globe made use of in electricity,
what he called the power of <i>attraction</i>,
would cease; but upon suffering the air again to
enter, it returned as vigorous as before. This must
be the case; for (as was before observed) whenever
the gross air is extracted by an air pump,
the fluid remaining is nothing but <i>light</i>. So,
whenever this attrition is performed on an exhausted
globe (for want of the resistance of the
gross air within, to force off the particles of air
ground so small as <i>light</i>, and thereby to make
an <i>expansion</i> or <i>rarefaction</i> round the glass globe,<span class="pagenum" title="37"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span>
which has been shewn to be the cause of light
bodies being <i>forced</i> towards the globe) these particles
of <i>light</i> do immediately enter the globe on
one side, and <i>force</i> out the same quantity on the
other; in the same manner as water through a
sieve, without ever making any <i>expansion</i> or <i>rarefaction</i>.</p>

<p>Having thus shewn how and by what means
the <i>fire</i> and <i>light</i> in electricity are produced; our
next inquiry must be, why some bodies communicate
this <i>light</i> to ever so great a distance, and
that instantaneously; whilst others will not; and
also, why some bodies are <i>electrical</i> and others
<i>non-electrical</i>.</p>

<p><i>Electrical bodies</i> are those, whose <i>pores</i> are so
<i>fine</i>, as to admit nothing through them but <i>light</i>,
or air ground to a proper fitness; as <i>metalls</i>, <i>glass</i>,
<i>amber</i>, <i>wax</i> &amp;c. Bodies <i>non-electrical</i>, are all
those, which, by the <i>largeness</i> of their <i>pores</i>, admit,
not only <i>light</i> but also <i>gross air</i>.</p>

<p>We see, when the air is <i>ground</i> to pieces by
an electrical machine, and <i>put</i> into <i>sufficient motion</i>,
by the <i>friction</i> between the glass globe and
the hand, a wire being hung from the iron barrel,
so as very near to touch the ball, part of
the <i>light</i> issuing from the ball, as above described,
<i>enters</i> the wire, and is by it communicated to the
iron barrel, and from thence <i>carried</i> by <i>another<span class="pagenum" title="38"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span>
wire</i> to any distance, if not interrupted by some
<i>non-electrical</i> body: to the end of which, by a
third wire is hung an egg; as soon as the globe
is put in <i>motion</i>, and warm spirit of wine is placed
so as to touch the egg, the spirit of wine
will immediately take fire from the contact of
the egg.</p>

<p>It has been already proved, that when the
globe is put in <i>motion</i>, and your hand is applied
to it, it <i>grinds</i> to pieces the air between the globe
and the hand, and so <i>rarefies</i> and <i>expands</i> it, and
sends it off with great force, in the same manner,
as <i>light</i> is sent from any body of <i>fire in action</i>;
as may be seen, if the electrical machine is
set at work in the dark; when the emission from
the glass globe will appear lucid.</p>

<p>The wires which are hung over the glass globe,
by the <i>smallness</i> of their <i>pores</i>, admitting nothing
through them but <i>light</i>, and light being a body
so <i>subtil</i>, as to penetrate the <i>pores</i> of all other bodies,
even to the very center of the earth; the
<i>interstices</i> of the <i>wires</i> are filled with it from one
end to the other.</p>

<p>As the <i>light</i> is one continued body, throughout
the whole extent of the wire, the <i>force</i> it receives
at the end next the glass globe, is <i>immediately</i>,
and at the <i>same instant</i> of time, communicated
to the other end, let the <i>length</i> or <i>extent</i> of the<span class="pagenum" title="39"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span>
wire be ever so great. As, for example, a pipe
of any length, being filled with any sort of fluid,
as water; if you force in more water at one end,
the same moment, and in the same quantity, it
will be forced out at the other.</p>

<p>By these experiments in electricity, we find
that <i>fire</i> and <i>light</i> are produced as has been before
observed, only by <i>breaking</i> the air to pieces,
and putting it in <i>motion</i>; and that <i>fire</i> and <i>light</i>
are in <i>all</i> bodies, water and ice not excepted; for,
if a piece of ice is hung at the end of the wire, it
will set fire to spirit of wine, as well as an egg.</p>

<p>The iron wire by the <i>closeness</i> of its <i>pores</i> prevents
the surrounding air from entering it, and
by that means at the same time forms a kind of
<i>canal</i> for the <i>light</i> to pass through.</p>

<p>Having thus as I conceive, given a tolerable
clear account, and, I hope, a true one, how and
by what means, the various <i>phænomena</i> in electricity
are produced; I suppose, it will not be a
very difficult task, to form a judgment, what
disorders electrical operations are likely to be applied
to, with hopes of service; as also in what
others they are likely to be detrimental.</p>

<p>As the <i>heat</i> and <i>redness</i> of the <i>blood</i>, may be
easily proved, to be in proportion to the <i>quantity</i>
and <i>motion</i> of the <i>light</i> it contains; so, wherever
the blood is <i>heated</i> to a great degree, as in <i>fevers</i>,<span class="pagenum" title="40"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span>
<i>Inflammations</i> of all kinds &amp;c. there we are to
expect the worst and most pernicious consequences,
from the use of electricity.</p>

<p>But, on the contrary, as the nerves have been
proved to act by a subtil fluid that passes through
them, and that they, by the closeness of their
pores, will not admit a fluid to pass through them,
whose particles are much larger than those of
<i>light</i>; the consequences we must often expect
from such a make, must be obstructions; and
as the <i>light</i> in electricity is forced through our
bodies and nerves, with great violence, it seems
very reasonable to think, that where these obstructions
are not too violent, there they may be
broken through and removed by its power, of
which we have had many instances, especially in
palsies.</p>

<p>This is also confirmed by the success of the
present practice of physick; for, the greatest relief,
in these cases, is always found to proceed
from <i>volatile</i> and <i>penetrating</i> medicines. But, care
should be taken, not to administer electricity, to
a person of weak and decayed nerves, instead of
one whose nerves are obstructed.</p>
